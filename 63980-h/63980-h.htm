alt="I" /></span> WAS musing alone one hot afternoon,<br /></span>
<span class="ih">In the shade of a vine on a bright day in June;<br /></span>
<span class="ih">Not a sound in the air but the hum of the bees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor a zephyr to sway the tops of the trees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cricket seemed tired of the shrill noise he made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The butterfly folded his wings in the shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flowers, so fragrant when day had begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer breathed perfume before the fierce sun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er nature a dull sleepy silence had grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even the clouds seemed moveless as stone.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Reclined in a chair, with my face towards the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tall posts of the telegraph thought-road near by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fancied I heard every word sent along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The short business message&mdash;the tale of some wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An accident, <i>not</i> on the Jersey railway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prices of stocks&mdash;events of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lover’s popped question, brief, pithy and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The assent of his charmer, his wishes to meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A summons to haste to the bed of a friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose life’s flickering taper drew near to its end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An invite to a wedding, a lecture or ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A county convention&mdash;a lyceum hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like leaves by the wild winter wind swept along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They came and they passed in a vast countless throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I watched and I listened with eager desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find out what passed through the quick thrilling wire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The date I was sure of&mdash;again and again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was “nineteen hundred and threescore and ten.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Came the first to a merchant of rank in Japan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying “Forward those teas as soon as you can.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In two minutes returned, “I will do as you say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But send me the Bibles you promised to-day.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Buy for me,” said a lady in Boston, in haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a dear Cuban friend, “(I trust to your taste);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A barrel of oranges, fresh from the tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dozen pine-apples, the fairest you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two bunches of large, ripe bananas&mdash;a cask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the best of preserves&mdash;’tis all that I ask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a few limes or lemons&mdash;smooth, juicy and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In time to prepare for my party to-night.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In half an hour came, propelled through the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fruits and the sweets packed with exquisite care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fair one, delighted, sent word to each friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far or near, a long sociable evening to spend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought that they came by balloon or by rail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the pneumatic tube, by steam or by sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the rate of a thousand of miles in a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the hub of New England hurrying away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next bit of news my very soul stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas the greatest explosion that ever was heard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An engine blew up, attached to a train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a hundred full cars on the Omaha plain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To atoms it flew, but no one was hurt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only some of the passengers covered with dirt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fireman was found half a mile from the spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safely lodged in a village whose name I’ve forgot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the engineer’s body was plunged in the sand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hid entirely from sight save a part of one hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both were struck with amaze at the quick change of base,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sole damage done, was a scratch on each face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reason was clear&mdash;their lives were insured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their limbs and their senses forever secured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a policy made with the greatest reliance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the “Fearless Assurance and Perpetual Defiance.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next sound arresting my listening ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was so soft and so musical, gentle and clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew it was sent by a company famed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The Harmonic Acoustic Tube Union, named,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a dozen performers, each one at his home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In London, Pekin, Paris, Athens and Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give in New York, at mass concerts free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oratorios by telegraph under the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then was heard such a hum from the mingled replies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could hear nothing more, but, trusting my eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked around as I strolled along each crowded street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some items to learn or acquaintance to meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The houses looked strange as if turned all to stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With huge gaudy creepers and ivy o’ergrown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether brick, wood or plaster, no signs of decay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could be seen, though an age had no doubt rolled away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since each corner-stone was laid deep and fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the wise master builder, all time to outlast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas a certain tried method, not patent, for all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoyed, free from tax, what inventions we call.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A liquid cement was poured on each place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hardened in time to a smooth flinty face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No wear could affect it&mdash;hot, cold, wet or dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was always the same to the touch and the eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Here’s a hint” I exclaimed, “to the men of our day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose work is so apt to break or decay.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“We are all honest, friend!” said some one quite near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your remark shows how little you know of us here.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turned to reply, but no one was in sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I saw with surprise and indeed with delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a double-track railway, as smooth as a floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been thoroughly laid, a few years before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A train was approaching&mdash;no whistle was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In loud screeching tones to drown every word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, soft as the evening wind wafted along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rung out the soft notes of that sweet Sabbath song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“There’s a happy land, far away, far away!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Till I thought they foretold a millenial day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wondered to see cars go noiselessly by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the rubber-tired wheels arrested my eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While each one inside looked calm and composed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they talked or they wrote, reflected or dozed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no thought of danger produced any dread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a tall thin Director walked quickly ahead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In less than a minute the cars disappeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I judged, on that line no collision was feared.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rambling on, as before, along the wide street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A smooth wooden pavement tempting the feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some boys stopped to greet me in passing to school,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas the custom of all, not enforced by a rule.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Can you tell me, my children,” I asked, with a smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where to find the hotel, to tarry awhile?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“My dear sir,” replied one with a bright, thoughtful face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I never have seen in my life such a place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The word sometimes is read on history’s page.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no buildings so-called, exist in this age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All houses are open to strangers who find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A home and warm friends if to stay they’re inclined.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Then show me, I pray, Dr. Cure-em-all’s room,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He died long ago&mdash;none can point out his tomb.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sickness is known here&mdash;diseases nor pains&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But pure blood is bounding in even old veins.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In doubt, I enquired, “Where is now Lawyer Grip?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh! he gave, as they say, all his clients the slip;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some affirm that he went over seas&mdash;others think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he drowned his senses, and life too, in drink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here his sign you may see, though the letters are pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the emblem beneath, a fox’s long tail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy years to you, sir! to school we must haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor longer the precious, short study-hours waste.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They ran on in glee and left me alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still in quest of the tavern that once I had known.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last it appeared, but such a great change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been made, that it looked surprisingly strange.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The low dirty room, dark with stains and with smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where revelry oft midnight sleepers awoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scene of mad riot and murderous strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blasphemy vile and obscenity rife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was now the clean entrance that led to a hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not built, as with us, for one sect, but for all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the rich and the poor, a true Christian band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In loving communion as brothers might stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To unite in thanksgiving, with hearts in accord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the same risen Saviour&mdash;one Father and Lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night and day tones of prayer and praise filled the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Till the Spirit’s blest presence seemed hovering there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No priest, man ordained, cried, “Know, brother, the Lord!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our High Priest and Minister gave the sure word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While o’erhead, wreathed with clouds, in letters of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone the words, “Be ye holy and clean in my sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the pure in heart only my face shall behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forever dwell safe in the heavenly fold.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How long in that temple divine was my stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never have known, as no words can convey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sense of the bliss, and ecstacy felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my spirit, unconscious of all as I knelt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save the heavenly gift of Infinite Love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descending on all from the Father above.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one fervent prayer for His grace to sustain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And guide me, my steps were turned earthward again.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some ruins near by, I found to disclose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spot where in old time a theatre rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one day by spontaneous combustion destroyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the place where it stood was a huge gaping void.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men were clearing the rubbish and cinders away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Odd relics of former years bringing to day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two masks that still seemed to be making grimaces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supposed to be dried skins of two actors’ faces;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a long rusted steel, whose use none could divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a scarlet robe wrapped, with one blazoned line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inscribed thereupon&mdash;’twas the name of a play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the legible words were, “The Devil’s Birthday.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hemlet of copper, with vizor of brass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was seen melted down, in a black, confused mass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With beads, trinkets, buttons and jewelry rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To allure the gay worldling or deck the frail fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“How sad!” said a voice, “they could ever bestow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time and thought on such follies a century ago!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon shall we raise on this desolate site,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A house sacred to truth, to knowledge and right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence millions of Bibles shall issue, to bless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distant nations still hungering for righteousness.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Musing deeply on all I had seen and had heard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wondrous changes I said not a word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But slowly went on, of adventures in quest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a spot with such peace and prosperity blest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each face, young and old, with intelligence beamed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every eye with love and with sympathy gleamed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No discord was known&mdash;no unrestrained tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave utterance to words of slander or wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such a sense of true happiness filled all the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed more than the spirit of mortal could bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heavenly anthem re-echoed again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“To God all the glory and good will to men!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pure fountains of water unceasingly flowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all nature with health and with happiness glowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every side, in long colonnade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pines, cedars and palms, threw their deep cooling shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On seats, for the tired, heated travellers made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the thick boughs above were filled with a throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of birds of gay plumage and exquisite song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unsuspicious of man, for his nature was changed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his love for all beings, no longer estranged.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They lived and they loved the green alcoves among,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or reared, year by year, unmolested, their young.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wrong, crime and deceit existed no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All houses were open&mdash;unguarded each door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No bolts and no bars told of robbers by night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No high prison walls offended the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stores of merchandise lay exposed to full view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For at last men were found to be honest and true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None was tempted one moment his neighbor to cheat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No deception was practiced in house or on street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one price was asked for each article sold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sole money used was silver and gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None knew what a panic in currency meant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A run upon banks or a gain cent per cent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stock gamblers on change no longer were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Bulls” and “Bears,” were strange names that once might have been.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of palaces built by legalized theft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or foul speculation, no vestige was left.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fraud in buying or selling was wholly unknown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light weight and short measure had obsolete grown;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaped high and pressed down and still running over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the sole rule and practice that I could discover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as no long accounts were kept day after day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No bankrupts were heard of&mdash;no failures to pay.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It seemed as if flying through vast unknown space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last I had reached some wonderful place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sin had not entered to blast and defile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scenes blest at creation by Deity’s smile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unlike our own earth, since the dawning of Time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despoiled by oppression or blackened by crime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rambling on in this deep contemplative mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before a vast pile I instinctively stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High in air rose a dome on which glittered a star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a lonely night beacon to wanderers afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on it, in lines pure as heaven’s own blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The old is now past and all things are new.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I entered&mdash;strange forms arrested the eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human inventions in ages gone by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tools for use&mdash;toys for pleasure&mdash;weapons of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Idols, altars and priestly shrines worshipped no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here was seen the rude ponderous Chaldean plow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the crown that adorned Melchizedek’s brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first harp that was made by old Tubal Cain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An image of Bel from a Syrian plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chariot of Pharoah, by Miriam sung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ages of silence with Red sea-weed hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now placed on the threshold of Dagon’s black shrine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where fell the foul god, smit by vengeance divine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge engines found buried in Egypt’s deep sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No doubt, by the builders of pyramids planned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jewish hammers once used on the mountains of Tyre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Persian censers where glowed perpetual fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pagodas from China, of porcelain rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gilt, silvered and papered with exquisite care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the image of gold on Dura’s vast plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the furnace of fire was thrice heated in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here, lay the light frame of an Indian canoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, a square Roman gallery attracted the view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these and a thousand more relics of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In its measureless rooms did the edifice hold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, greater by far, both in number and cost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of murderous implements grim war could boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cut, maim and mingle the fair human form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In private revenge or in battle’s wild storm.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In another huge hall lay the rough knotty brand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still stained as it dropped from Cain’s murderous hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spears and the swords of nations of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the deluge a vile generation swept o’er.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here stood the old chariots, each wheel with a scythe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath which men prostrate in anguish would writhe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, ranged as in former stern battle array<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone the armor of brass used in Rome’s warlike day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helmets, spears, shields, javelins, pikes, swords and slings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the banners, surmounted by eagles’ broad wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cross-bows of England and rude culverin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Side by side with the Fijean war-club were seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The battle-axe, steeped in Mohammedan gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Indian tomahawk&mdash;Scottish claymore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rude scalping knife of the savage there lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the civilized bayonet rusting away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guns, pistols, revolvers, mortars, cannon and bombs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were placed in the midst of gongs and of drums.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here new patent rifles from near and from far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disclosed the latest improvements in war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All sorts of vessels for fight were displayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Malayan war junk, for piracy made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frigate, with rows of black guns gaping wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the iron-ribbed Monitor’s steel-plated side.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On the long lofty walls of the building, were hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scenes of strife, from the day that our planet was young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the hour, when mankind, by one solemn vow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were pledged no longer such crimes to allow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas a sickening sight&mdash;like demons from hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glared the eyes of the wounded and dying who fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trampled down in hot haste, like the mire in the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unregarded or spurned by the wayfarers’ feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above, the dun war-clouds their canopy drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with horror I shrunk from the terrible view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping much that man, made in likeness divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To conflict and bloodshed should ever incline.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, as gleams of bright silver will oft line a cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cold, dismal and black as a funeral shroud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, high o’er the red tide of battle, a scroll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inscribed by an angel-hand, seemed to unroll:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The work of the just and the righteous is peace&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its effect, rest and surety that never shall cease.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Light breaking again in my sorrowful heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With more cheerful feelings I rose to depart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But again was amazed, more relics to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the devil’s vast power and rule o’er mankind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man’s record was here with Slavery’s stains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its whips and its handcuffs&mdash;its fetters and chains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the midst, the old time-worn whipping-post stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its platform deep stained with long streams of blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on it the form of a suppliant slave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beseeching for mercy and aid no one gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jeers and taunts from the crowd were the only reply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And demoniac hate shone forth from each eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near by was an auction, whence rose the loud cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Likely negroes for sale! come, gentlemen, buy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here goes a mulatto, young, handsome and sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Note her beautiful teeth, her limbs smooth and round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark her elegant bust, her long glossy hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her ankle that will with Venus’ compare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such a bright, lovely face is not seen every day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then put her up, gentlemen, what do you say?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a thousand is bid!&mdash;she must go on the shelf;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At such a low price I will take her myself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two thousand! “down came the quick hammer, “she’s gone.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The auctioneer growled in a low sneering tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the only reply was the slave’s subdued groan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here’s another chance, gentlemen&mdash;come near the stand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A healthy young negress, brought up by hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her regular teeth prove her yet in her prime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While her well-knitted arms tell of work in her time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She can cook, wash and iron&mdash;pick cotton or sew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the twins at her side, productiveness show.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will sell them together or singly, as best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may judge, for their owner no choice has expressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How much shall I have for the mother, alone?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis a positive sale of flesh and of bone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six hundred is all that I hear&mdash;what a price!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may double it safely, is all my advice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven, eight&mdash;cheap as dirt! nine, ten, are you done?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bargain for you, sir! an A., number one!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now for a boy; stand up, you young dog!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don’t be blubbering there like a water-soaked log;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give a fair bid at once&mdash;right quick, if you please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friends, for I shall not dwell long upon these!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O! massa!” for mercy, my darling boys buy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried the wo-stricken mother, “without them I die!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tittering laugh was the sole answer given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I knew that appeal was recorded in heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Again the sharp ring of the hammer was heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with it, the oath-enforced threatening word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Tear the niggers apart, gag the woman’s black mouth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the young rascals stay while she goes further south.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt my blood boil&mdash;my arm rising to deal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One blow at the wretch, conscience hardened as steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a low, gentle voice I could but obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whispered: “Vengeance is mine&mdash;I the Lord, will repay!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking upwards, sweet faces, like angels’ were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those who the friends of the bondsman had been.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once, hated and scorned by the proud ones of earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None could tell in that day the amount of their worth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They toiled to remove all oppression and crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With faith ever strong in their mission sublime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the white harvest field, ’till their sands were all run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the welcome was heard, “Faithful servant! well done!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Once more, to another apartment I turned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My bosom, with more indignation yet burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I viewed all the engines of torture employed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under guise of religion, when thousands destroyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confessed before man a God answering prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And died in the faith they had lived to declare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here were thumbscrews, racks, pillories, scaffolds and thongs&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, the irons oft-heated to bore human tongues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the chains and the whips to torment, maim and slay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christian sufferers in dungeons remote from the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the middle arose the huge black corner stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that building of Rome, long centuries known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the devil’s own priests loved to torture and pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And autos de-fe soiled the blue skies of Spain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O! shame!” I exclaimed, that Satan should bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such hellish arts the souls of mankind&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That man, the object of Infinite Love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cruelest foe to his brother should prove!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Too true, my dear sir,” a mild voice replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, turning, I saw an old man at my side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose silver locks swept his broad shoulders&mdash;whose brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed no furrow or scar from Time’s rugged plow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eye beaming bright as in infancy’s days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While his every word seemed attuned unto praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Too true! but ’tis past&mdash;all the horrors of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Persecution and slavery, now are no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This edifice, piled with mementos of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tells how wicked and vile former ages have been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, to deepest abysses of infamy hurled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They lived and they died without God in the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, thanks be to Him, the Father and Son&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An unending reign of peace hath begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Holy Spirit now circling the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All creation is pure as when called into birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But few enter here&mdash;too painful the sight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Other scenes, other objects our people invite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do good and communicate is our sole aim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our works prove, as Christians, we merit the name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then mourn not, my friend, at the picture of crime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That polluted the world and the record of Time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up! pilgrim! I bid thee, God-speed on thy way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Till it lead through the mists to perpetual day!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I arose&mdash;deep gratitude filling my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From such a wise counsellor, loth to depart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Many thanks,” I rejoined, “for thy true kindness shown&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Henceforth I will look on the bright side alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell! for thou art well, thy words clearly prove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though thy home be on earth, thy life is above!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We parted, with souls in communion true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, to point out the past, I my path to pursue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep musing upon the old things I had seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To doubt almost inclined that such had e’er been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in grateful emotion that vice, crime and war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er this our fair earth should run riot no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stood by the edge of a wide and deep bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose blue waters mingled with ocean’s white spray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On its shore vessels lay with canvass full furled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While others were fitting to sail round the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They floated as light on the clear glassy tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As snow-breasted swans in their beauty and pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buoyed up by some new&mdash;some magical art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gentlest zephyr impelled them to start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when, leaving port, the wind filled each sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They skimmed the wide waters like leaves in a gale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, far stranger than these&mdash;a wonderful sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High above, were vast air-ships, with pinions as light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As those of the sea bird, that, day after day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwearied, in solitude wings its long way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright streamers on every side gracefully swayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now tossed high in air and now pendent in shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I read, as I stood mid the gathering crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The Arrow, the Meteor, the Swift Flying Cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sunbeam, Wave, Northern Light, Iris,” and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moored proudly above that dense peopled shore.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas a glorious sight as they swung in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impatient, as ’twere, their burden to bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, tempted, I stepped up a spiral stairway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A short flying visit to Europe to pay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rung the note of departure&mdash;outspread the huge wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we rose, so to speak, o’er terrestrial things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fainter came from the crowd each last parting cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Till in one confused hum, they were lost to the ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faded then from the sight the houses and trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we went higher up, swept along by the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the land and the sea far below in mist lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Till we lost sight of mountain, rock, river and bay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now as the twilight still deepened to night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’erhead shone the stars in a full blaze of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the broad calm expanse of ocean below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw like another bright galaxy glow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fair was the scene, I asked one near by,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Do tempests ne’er blow or clouds darken your sky?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“No! no! my good friend, by Omniscient decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From storm, fire and flood, earth forever is free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The elements now are propitious to man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing now mars a wise Deity’s plan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds are not fickle nor faithless the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For He, who hath promised, His sure word will keep.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For many an hour I gazed at the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwilling to shut from such splendor my eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Till, tired at the thought of infinite space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought in the cabin, a calm resting place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was filled with guests from every land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From cold Labrador to Afric’s hot sand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Chinaman, Hindoo, Turk, Arab and Jew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men in fact, from all parts of the old world and new.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light that illumed the spacious saloon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was as white and as clear as the midsummer moon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas the pure beam galvanic, soft, steady and free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all noxious fumes that with health disagree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I heard that the engine that moved our light bark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the same that gave out the bright flashing spark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no oil was now used, nor explosive compound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On earth, among all nations was found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light, heat and motion at last were attained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By one simple and practical instrument gained.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sides of that noble apartment were dressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gems of rare art from the east and the west;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here a statue stood poised, just ready to fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, a picture of Saturn’s new belt caught the eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one thing I noticed&mdash;or fiction, or fact,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good of mankind prompted every act&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, the converse of all, whether light, grave or gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was married by no folly, whate’er men night say.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the bell sounded one&mdash;I entered my berth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rest in mid air, safe as on the firm earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the night long heard the quivering beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wings in their slow and measured repeat.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Up! sunrise is reddening the earth and the sky!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried the voice of some one, without waiting reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I sprang from my couch to watch the long gleam<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tip our beautiful pennon with morning’s first beam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It came and it bathed in warm rosy hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vessel, as faster through light mists it flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till we thought of that word that once echoed sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Light! be!” and Day marked the divisions of time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus we winged our swift course through the cool upper air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now meeting a ship in the atmosphere rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now skimming above the blue boundless deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its waves by warm zephyrs lulled softly to sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last a gray cloud seemed to rise in the north;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It neared us&mdash;and soon the glad sea-cry went forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Land! ho! ’tis old England&mdash;her white cliffs arise!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we crowd to the front in joy and surprise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There it lay, in green beauty, but not as of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its forts and its cannon bristling the shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hushed were the thunders that rolled o’er the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no vessels of war polluted her strand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We stopped just above the world-renowned mart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of London, where science, wealth, learning and art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The treasures of ages, in countless store lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reserved ’till the dawn of a happier day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, softly descending, we stepped on firm ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view the new objects and people around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grim Tower rose before us&mdash;we entered the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unguarded, as once by stern orders of state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the jewels that in the rich diadems shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer could tempt one to take for his own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exposed on all sides, were rich scepters of kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tiaras, pearls, gems and a thousand bright things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once prized as the emblems of place and of power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now thought mere childish toys of the hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vestments of royalty too were displayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silk, satin, chenille, velvet, plush and brocade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With exquisite work of silver and gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fine threads that shone on each rich wavy fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I heard with surprise an attendant confess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas the work of long years to complete a court dress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What folly!” I cried, “to deck the outside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With garments to flatter and foster one’s pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the soul, the true being, of measureless worth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is less prized and less cared for than mean things of earth.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Where now are the lions,” I asked, “once confined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brute prisoners, to show the power of mankind?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O! their nature was changed and unchained now they roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find in the wide world, food, shelter and home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curse that on Adam in Paradise fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattering seeds of hate, desolation and hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is now gone forever&mdash;no wild beasts abound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at last in his works God’s true image is found.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Looking down on the river, I marked its calm face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half hid by white sails from every place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strange looking junk from distant Japan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unchanged in its form since the empire began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light buoyant bark of more modern time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adapted for use in every clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swift gliding steamer with paddle or screw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frigate, no longer exposing to view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its port-holes whence issued the missiles of war&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For strife, hate and conflict existed no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred bright flags were floating in air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each, the name of some country or race to declare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not, as once, the proud banner to wave in the fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The theme of the poet&mdash;the warrior’s delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the emblem of peace and of love among men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long ago sung by angels on Bethlehem’s plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas a glorious sight&mdash;but I could not delay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, descending the Tower, swiftly passed on my way.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All the streets seemed alive with a slow-moving throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no jostling was known as they travelled along;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every one knew another, each face beamed with joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nought was heard, seen, or felt to annoy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The streets and the pavements were so smoothly laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For safety and ease, both for man and beast made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one might walk on from morning till night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfatigued, to enjoy each varying sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand wide stores were thrown open to view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piled with goods whose use our fathers ne’er knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were garments for all, without stitch or seam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robes dyed as in colors of sunset’s rich beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wings on frames, to be used on the earth or in air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With speed on his journey the pilgrim to bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But time will not allow me the list to rehearse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all these strange sights, in this fugitive verse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffice it to say, every thing that I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was strictly conformed to one excellent law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That forbade all mankind to make or to use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Any goods that a Christian would ever refuse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No trimmings nor ribbons hung flying around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No vile trashy novels on book shelves were found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No flaring, gay posters announced some bold lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made only to catch the gaping crowd’s eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No cards in the windows were seen to declare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the cheapest and best in the world were sold there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No drinking saloons stared full in one’s face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No compounders of liquors were seen in the place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had all gone below with the spirits accursed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all Satan’s agents the vilest and worst.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tobacco was none&mdash;no smoker’s breath there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Annoyed the nice sense or corrupted the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surprised at the fact, “How is this? I enquired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a patriarch near me, in pure white attired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied, “Is it true that one being on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knows not that the world was reformed in new birth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have heard, when a boy, my grandsire affirm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the plant in one night was destroyed by a worm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never since then, half a century ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has any one seen it or known it to grow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The panic from pole to equator was great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As any past earthquake was known to create,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some ventured to say that thousands indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would die for the want of their favorite weed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the prophecy failed&mdash;from disuse followed health,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purer lives, better morals and wisdom and wealth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“And where are the dram shops&mdash;the houses for dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, heated by wine and lost as in trance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full many a maiden drank, stumbled and fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Once pure as a snow-flake) from heaven to hell.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Alas! my dear friend, how little you know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the great revolution the world now can show.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When mankind o’er the globe acknowledged the sway<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the great King of kings all are bound to obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All sin disappeared; lust, passion and crime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer defiled the annals of Time;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None dared to entice his weak brother to wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None wished to provoke or by action or tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None, the health or the comfort of one living soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a moment would wish to restrain or control.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with feelings like these, who, the heavens below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could continue a trade fraught with ruin and wo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No! no! pure religion can never annoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The peace of mankind or their good-will destroy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if God, as his works clearly argue, be love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose dwelleth in Him shall his follower prove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every thing that the soul of man can defile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is purged from the earth by Deity’s smile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath cleansed the whole world, through his only Son’s blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seen, as in Paradise, all his works good.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Delightful!” I cried, “that all evil hath ceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And man from the thraldom of sin is released;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who e’er would have dared, amid doubts and fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To predict such a change in the past hundred years?”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We parted, and, entering a new city car<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On polished rails sliding, without noise or jar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was soon the rich and green pastures among,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In history famed and by poets long sung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lovely hamlets and villages dotted each vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the sweet breath of wild flowers scented the gale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vine clung to the roof with its clusters of fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fig, fearless of winter, expanded each shoot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bright golden orange gleamed through the dark leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the robin her nest built beneath the low leaves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I looked, but could see no idler there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounds of labor alone arose on the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each his neighbor would aid if his own part were done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From day’s early dawn to the set of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a bee hive, the land seemed with people alive.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all nature in peace and in plenty to thrive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the wayside stood rows of wide spreading trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose yield or whose shade could refresh or could please.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one law reigned o’er all&mdash;each, with Christian regard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sought his neighbor’s best good as his own rich reward.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I looked for the buildings benevolence reared&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were none, for the paupers had all disappeared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No blind, sick, deaf, lame, or feeble of mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all my wide wanderings on earth could I find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The homes for the friendless, deserted or poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vainly hoped by their founders, all time to endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were devoted to Science, not blind, as of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Alchemy sought to turn dross into gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But certain and true, illumed from on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the pure Fount of light ever turning her eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were school rooms, lyceums and vast lecture halls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all treasures of Time, densely filling the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While professors of every known science and art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sought the mind to inform or to lead the young heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The longs rows of workshops for artisans made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer their low, dusty windows displayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where faint, toil-worn hundreds met sickness and death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the close stifling air, corrupted by breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sunlight enlivened each lofty-walled room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each rounded cheek showed freshness and bloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The master was ever the workers among,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their health to secure&mdash;not their labors prolong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No law was required&mdash;as a Christian, he knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He to others should act as he wished them to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No poisonous gas was floating in air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sowing germs of disease and of death everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the vapors evolved, by chemical skill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were innocuous made, other ends to fulfil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men who long delved in the deep gloomy mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid’ the fire-damp, allowed their bright lanterns to shine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the light they now used created no heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twere idle to think any danger to meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the air, so mephitic of old time, became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As oxygen pure, when it met the soft flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Roamed the deer through the streets of the populous town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not now with swift steeds and fierce dogs hunted down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fox and the hare lived in the same den<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On intimate terms, unmolested by men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every beast, bird or fish, by night and by day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer regarded each other its prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, protected by man, to his friendship proved true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love bound all creatures in league ever new.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought was seen, nought was heard but gladness and praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the blessings that crowned those bright halcyon days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even from Erin thanksgiving was heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Till the gray crags of Scotland with echoes were stirred.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I returned to the sea where the white cliffs arose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As landmarks to show how the tide ebbs and flows;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Adieu to Old England! exulting, I cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where order, peace, love and religion abide!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the nations who spent blood and treasure in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, who once was the first, ambitious no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now sends forth her people to each distant land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To teach and to preach at the Saviour’s command!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As I gazed o’er the deep, entranced at the view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a vapor or cloud dimmed the fair boundless blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At my feet the waves with joy seemed to dance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the piers of an air-tube, the high road to France,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, lying at ease on a rich velvet bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impelled like an arrow, in safety I sped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er the channel that washes each bold rocky shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First united&mdash;then severed&mdash;but now linked once more.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The manners of every one caused such surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unprepared as I was, I could scarce trust my eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The butterfly airs and the light lively tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By which, time out of mind, the Frenchman was known.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been changed to a sober yet cheerful address<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marked with smiles and true dignity, few can express.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every look, every gesture evinced that they knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That courtesy based on religion is true.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All frivolity gone&mdash;vain amusements forgot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found not in city or country one spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where an opera, ball-room or theatre stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To arouse evil thoughts or to stifle the good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sabbath, profaned for long centuries past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was observed, not by sorrowful penance or fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the nation obeyed the divine command given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rest and to worship one day in seven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gay gardens and palaces, open of yore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where drinkers and dancers by turns trod the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were thronged by a multitude ever inclined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To read or to hear what would profit the mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No imperial rule forced each class to obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No autocrat, king or dictator held sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A firm free Republic framed long time ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proved popular still, as Time’s chronicles show.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No soldier police stood guard to detect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrest or confine&mdash;there was none to suspect.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout the wide land not a murmur was heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No quarrel was known&mdash;none spake an ill word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I thought, as I travelled through country or town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas as if heaven itself, to earth had come down.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We passed on the rail, swift as birds cleave the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vales dotted with villages&mdash;mountain peaks bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tinged in the sunlight with soft golden hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many a league ’till the Alps met our view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There they stood&mdash;their proud forms towering up in the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no traces of glaciers or snow, met the eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since the time all mankind had known the new birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One perpetual spring had encircled the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cold, heat, frost, storm and ice were unknown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No earthquakes now rumbled beneath each broad zone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Volcanoes were none&mdash;their fires were decayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cities no longer in ruins were laid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the slopes of Italian vales caught the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every glance at the scene called forth new delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun-embrowned peasants in vineyard or field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were tilling each crop or gathering the yield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich clambering vines o’er the road threw their shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tropic banana its broad leaf displayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the palm, like a monarch with sceptre and crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er the lowlier trees of the forest looked down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The olive, the fig and the pomegranate there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repaid in abundance the laborer’s care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mingled perfume of a thousand sweet flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like incense arose from the thick orange bowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the train still sped on, and now in the haze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That purpled the hills in the sun’s level rays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The columns and temples of Rome rose in view,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spires, domes and palaces, ancient and new.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We entered where once the chariots rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the vast Coliseum, when centuries old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw the sandy arena clotted with gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While above the death groan rung the lion’s wild roar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer the massive walls crumbled and fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its decay and its ruin for ages to tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The huge pile was now used for a far higher aim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the praise of a pagan emperor’s name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rebuilt and remodelled, it rung with the cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Our Lord, GOD omnipotent reigneth on high!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the city then hastening, I marked with surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Romish processions attracted all eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No beggars, the pest of the traveller, were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No long lines of priests with crosses between,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No nuns in black robes paraded the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No close-shaven monks with bare head and feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poverty, dirt and all the vile trade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beggary everywhere brings to its aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Existed no more in that land once debased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Their name and remembrance forever effaced.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each dark piercing eye with a purer light shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passion, anger and feuds were entirely unknown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the love, the apostle once preached, by God’s grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspired every heart and lit up each face.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soon we neared the vast&mdash;the magnificent shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where once to base man was paid homage divine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noble proud dome named St. Peter’s of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the warm sunset gleaming resplendent as gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No cross now surmounted the dizzying height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A star hung above it, as pure and as bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the one that once stood o’er the manger and bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the Saviour of sinners first rested his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I entered the courts, for hundreds of years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trod by the pilgrims deluded, in sorrow and tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where thousands knelt bowing to image or cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than true worship loving the world and its dross.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No crucifix now was lifted on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No priest called for penance from crowds passing by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No form carved in ivory, wood, brass or stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mocked the traits that belong to the Godhead alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sensuous pictures of Virgin and child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased the mass, to false adoration beguiled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A light, clear and holy, words cannot express,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pervaded the spot and illumined each recess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the hosts of the faithful from every land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admired the change wrought by Almighty command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that temple where infancy, manhood and youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worshipped God, their Creator, in spirit and truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Does the Pope,” I enquired, “in the Vatican live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the people yet think he their sins can forgive?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh! no!” said a gray-haired old man at my side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Many years have elapsed since the last Pontiff died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a far distant shore, exiled, pining he lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soul filled with remorse at the thought of that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he claimed, in his pride, God’s vicegerent to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receiving vile homage of lip and of knee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the long line of the popes, there was none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save he, who confessed to his Saviour alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, through mercy divine, his own sins forgiven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His purified soul passed from earth into heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This house, once the scene of debauch and of crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where blasphemy reigned supreme at one time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, sacred to worship, pure, heart-felt and true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is blest with a Presence old ages ne’er knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the gospel is preached, undefiled as of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Science, so called, to false doctrines the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Scriptures, first penned for the comfort of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are read by the light of the Spirit again.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Do the people to image or crucifix bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the priests for all crimes absolution allow?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“From your question, my friend, I judge that you came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From some other planet, unknown yet by name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or perhaps may have slumbered, unconscious of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the world was restored in its innocent prime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come then to the halls where Science combined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With truth and religion enlighten the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where genius, art and sound reason are found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And errors of schoolmen no longer abound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Superstition has fled, like the mists of the night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dispersed when the sun comes in glorious light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rome, once the foul den of crime, lust and sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is purged from all evil, her precincts within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remain then and see what treasures untold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They who witness Messiah’s blest advent, behold.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Time presses,” I said, “in an hour I must start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In an ocean-bound steamer, ready to part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thanks for all I have seen and have heard thee declare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, to the New World, glad tidings I bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the kingdoms of earth all acknowledge the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Redeemed and restored by his life giving word.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We parted&mdash;then taking some newly-formed shoes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For swift and sure travel on water to use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I passed down the Tiber&mdash;not yellow as when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its stained turbid wave, washed valley and glen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sparkling, fresh, clear and pure as the dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on every spray reflects heaven’s own blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White villas, temples and towns lined the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gondolier sung, as he dipped his light oar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the hills echoed back the sweet solemn hymn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From morning’s first dawn, ’till the daylight grew dim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With long rapid strides o’er the waters I sped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And distanced the sea-gulls that flew o’er my head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon the wide river entered a rich, grassy plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where its fresh waters mingled with those of the main.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, lay the fair vessel with quivering wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a bird on the tree-top that flutters and sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just ready to soar through the measureless sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er mead, hill and vale, and precipice high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clarion rung&mdash;we left Italy’s shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the old classic sea were fast flying o’er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a day we touched Cadiz&mdash;that bold rocky height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the guns of Gibraltar once blazed in the fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now streaming with flags from every clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In token that Peace held dominion sublime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas dusk&mdash;a brilliant red rocket flew high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er the vertical wall far up in the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While another swept down in the ocean below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lingered long after in roseate glow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The parting salute, with cheer upon cheer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was answered, ’till sound died away on the ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing was heard but the murmuring deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wings’ measured stroke inviting to sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We glided as swift on the ocean’s expanse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the leaves that in the wild hurricane dance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea glowed with fire from creatures unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brighter far than the stars in the zenith they shone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And myriad flocks of strange sea birds lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the face of the deep, awaiting the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No moon rose that night, but e’re twilight was gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky seemed to glow with a rich northern dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not ’till our flag in the morning breeze swayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did its soft lambent light from the firmament fade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus for three days and nights we skimmed the blue main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now watching the air ships again and again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now noting far down in the green, glassy brine,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iron vessels with fins&mdash;a submarine line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propelled by galvanic action alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made to explore ocean’s chambers unknown.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Meantime I conversed with some that I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came from far distant climes, new wonders to view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the change wrought on earth since the era began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Christ reigned supreme, acknowledged by man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No pen could describe nor could language declare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glory His saints were permitted to share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the devil and all his foul works were destroyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And happiness dwelt in each heart unalloyed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“But how,” I inquired, “was the old world renewed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a day by Omniscient fiat made good?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or purged in long years from sin and its leaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Till God saw on its bosom the image of heaven?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“As a thief in the night breaks in unaware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So flashed on the earth, mid its pleasure and care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A splendor surpassing the sun’s noontide ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foretelling the dawn of millenial day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attended by thousands of saints came the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bless his redeemed and to drive the abhorred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As erst he once drove the angels that fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From allegiance, down from high heaven to hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ’till then, increased both evil and good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As men a false phantom or true peace pursued.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though tales of new crime thrilled the ear and the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirit of prayer seemed its power to control;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reform spread, as years rolled rapidly by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at last from all races beneath every sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shouts of thanksgiving and praises again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth echoed the cry, “Alleluia! Amen!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the soft evening wind that our light bark swept o’er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flower-scented, announced we were nearing the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere night’s somber curtain had veiled the red sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glare of bright lamps arrested the eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas a populous city of wealth and of fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled with thousands of every class, country and name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I passed through the streets&mdash;no tumult was there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No low profane words polluted the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No theatre belched out at midnight a throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inflamed with drugged wine and lascivious song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All was peaceful and still, as a calm Sabbath day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For man was no more to his brother a prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each dwelling I entered revealed the true sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Christian communion&mdash;the Presence Divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they in whose souls His graces abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In each other’s friendship forever confide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fatigued with my journey&mdash;deprived of my rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long time I remained in that city a guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pondering deeply on all I had seen and had heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Till my soul from its deepest recesses was stirred.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There was seen in all things such a marvellous change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One could hardly imagine an era so strange;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here a library stood with its wide open door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clerks and librarian needed no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the readers took works from their place on the shelves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And duly returned them uninjured themselves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No comic nor frivolous lectures were known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instruction and knowledge were sought for alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were schools for the infant, the child and the aged;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all labors of love the fair sex was engaged;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No voting was heard of&mdash;no taxes were paid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For religion from government needed no aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout the wide world not a vestige was found<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of weeds that for ages were known to abound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor a poisonous serpent to sting or annoy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor an insect, the rich harvest hopes to destroy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun, moon and stars each in turn gave their light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One scorched not by day, while the rest warmed the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nature was fair as the garden of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Paradise once by angel feet trod.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Blest world!” I exclaimed, “all honor and praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be to Him who now rules these millenial days!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fervor I spoke&mdash;raised my hand towards the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the soft whisper of some one near by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then turned just in time to see sunset’s last gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the present rushed back, and lo! ’twas a dream!<br /></span>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
